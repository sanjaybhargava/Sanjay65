Thank you for joining the beta.

Here's what makes this different: no overwhelming portfolios, no 47-step plans, no upsells. Just practical education with actions you can take that reduce financial anxiety.

You have 9 lessons and 2 calculators waiting, designed for different life stages:

IF YOU'RE STARTING OUT:
Begin with your Save Number calculator â†’ shows you exactly how much you need to stop worrying about money forever.

IF YOU'RE ESTABLISHED:
Start with your Spend Number calculator â†’ reveals how much you can spend guilt-free on whatever makes you happy.

Both take 3 minutes. Pick whichever fits your situation.

After that, you'll find lessons tailored to where you are in life. 

Play with the lessons and calculators. The more you use them the clearer they will become.

Two asks:
1. If you find this useful, share it with others: https://bit.ly/IA_Prototype

2. Give us feedback - what's working, what's not, what's missing? Your input shapes what we build next. Our aim is to eliminate financial anxiety, and you can help make that happen.

P.S. Don't try to do everything at once. One calculator, then one lesson. Progress beats perfection.

All the Best,
